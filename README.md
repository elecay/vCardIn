A basic FirefoxOS app importer for contacts from a vCard file

https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/vcardin (awaiting review) 

This project is just starting.

TODO:

- Add the option of "Select all" for the files to import
- Add the option of choosing the specific details for the contacts to import
- ~~Field to specify the path of the file inside the SDCARD~~ Root by default until we get a file browser on FirefoxOS
- ~~User interface (and some beatiful icons -Pablo Massa?-)~~ Thanks Pablo!
- ~~Tests (check a valid vCard, version 3.0 only supported right now)~~
- ~~Refactoring (make the code a little nicer)~~
- ~~Define a License (MIT? GNU?)~~ GLP 3.0
- ~~Publishing on Firefox Marketplace (for free, of course)~~
