A basic FirefoxOS app importer for contacts from a vCard file

This project is just starting.

TODO:

- Add the option of "Select all" for the files to import
- Add the option of choosing the specific details for the contacts to import
- Add spanish version (and more languages)
- ~~Field to specify the path of the file inside the SDCARD~~
    ~~Root by default until we get a file browser on FirefoxOS~~
    ~~User can pick the files(s) from a list of .vcf availables~~
- ~~User interface (and some beatiful icons -Pablo Massa?-)~~ Thanks Pablo!
- ~~Tests (check a valid vCard, version 3.0 only supported right now)~~
- ~~Refactoring (make the code a little nicer)~~
- ~~Define a License (MIT? GNU?)~~ GLP 3.0
- ~~Publishing on Firefox Marketplace (for free, of course)~~
